# Hypomnema architecture

This page states what is implemented today, and nothing else. The target is in [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md);
planned work is in GitHub issues and never appears here as a fact. Update this page in the change that makes a
statement true or false.

## Binaries

| Binary | Commands | What it does today |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd/hypomnema` (control plane) | `serve`, `version` | Opens its SQLite database and serves `/livez` and `/readyz` |
| `cmd/hypomnema-node` (node) | `version` | Prints its version |

Configuration comes from the environment: `HYPOMNEMA_HTTP_ADDR` (default `127.0.0.1:8080`),
`HYPOMNEMA_DATABASE_PATH` (required, absolute), `HYPOMNEMA_LOG_LEVEL`, `HYPOMNEMA_LOG_FORMAT` (`json` or `text`).
Logs are JSON on stdout; `serve` stops on SIGINT or SIGTERM and lets requests in flight finish. `/readyz` answers 503
with `Retry-After` while the database does not answer.

The database ([decision](docs/decisions/2026-11-07-sqlite.md)) is one SQLite file opened by `internal/shared/sqlite`:
one connection, WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, pragmas read back after opening; its directory is made 0700 and a new file
0600, and an existing file that group or others can access, or that another user owns, is refused (Linux).

## Code

```
internal/controlplane     package controlplane: configuration and serving
internal/shared/platform  environment settings, slog logger, HTTP server and probes, version
internal/shared/sqlite    SQLite opening, pragmas and file permissions
```

There is no `internal/node` and no vault yet. Boundaries ([decision](docs/decisions/2026-11-07-two-deployables.md))
are checked by `make verify`: depguard rules per tree in `.golangci.yml` (the SQLite driver only in `shared/sqlite`,
`database/sql` only in packages that own tables), and `deps-check`, which refuses the control plane in the node binary
and the node in the control plane binary.

## Verification

- `make verify`: gofmt, `go mod tidy -diff` for both modules, golangci-lint (`.golangci.yml`, tools pinned in
  `tools/ci/go.mod`), the dependency check, unit tests and race tests.
- Tests that need a database open a real file in a temporary directory; no containers.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `make verify` and `govulncheck` on every pull request and on `main`.
