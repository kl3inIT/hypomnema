# Hypomnema architecture

This page states what is implemented today, and nothing else. The target is in [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md);
planned work is in GitHub issues and never appears here as a fact. Update this page in the change that makes a
statement true or false.

## Binaries

| Binary | Commands | What it does today |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd/hypomnema` (control plane) | `migrate`, `serve`, `version`, `nodes add\|list`, `accounts add\|list`, `tokens add\|list\|revoke`, `login`, `run`, `answer`, `questions` | `migrate` brings the database schema up to the binary's version; `serve` refuses any other schema, then serves `/livez`, `/readyz`, the node API, the client API and the web client, and runs the scheduler loop; the other commands are the owner's (below) |
| `cmd/hypomnema-node` (node) | `init`, `check`, `accounts set`, `run`, `service`, `shim`, `mcp`, `version` | `init --url --token-file` writes the node's configuration; `check` says hello once and lists the CLIs it found; `accounts set` records where an account's Claude token is; `run` runs the daemon with the Claude runner; `service` prints a systemd user unit; `shim` runs one worker and `mcp` serves its tools (both started for a worker, not by hand) |

Configuration comes from the environment: `HYPOMNEMA_HTTP_ADDR` (default `127.0.0.1:8080`),
`HYPOMNEMA_DATABASE_PATH` (required, absolute), `HYPOMNEMA_LOG_LEVEL`, `HYPOMNEMA_LOG_FORMAT` (`json` or `text`),
`HYPOMNEMA_ROLES` (role defaults as JSON; default `{"implement": {"runtime": "claude"}}`).
Logs are JSON on stdout; `serve` stops on SIGINT or SIGTERM and lets requests in flight finish. `/readyz` answers 503
with `Retry-After` while the database does not answer.

The database ([decision](docs/decisions/2026-11-07-sqlite.md)) is one SQLite file opened by `internal/shared/sqlite`:
one connection, WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, pragmas read back after opening; its directory is made 0700 and a new file
0600, and an existing file that group or others can access, or that another user owns, is refused (Linux).

Migrations are goose SQL files embedded in the binary (`internal/controlplane/orchestration/migrations`); the schema
holds Runs, Tasks, Task dependencies, Dispatches, Conversations, receipts, Dispatch effects and resources, account
cooldowns, questions, the event log, nodes, accounts and client tokens. `internal/controlplane/orchestration` is their only writer: named operations, each one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
transaction, every status change a guarded `UPDATE` checked against a transition table (`transitions.go`).

- Runs and Tasks: create a Run, create Tasks with dependencies, cancel or reopen a Task, finish or cancel a Run. A
  Task becomes ready when all its dependencies succeeded; a failed or canceled Task blocks every Task downstream of
  it; reopening a failed Task resets its failure count and unblocks them.
- Dispatches: the coordinator creates one for a ready Task, in a new Conversation or continuing the open one; a node
  accepts it (a new epoch and a 90 s lease), reports it started, renews the lease, reports progress, effects
  (intent, then done) and resources, and reports the outcome. A lost lease or an exit without a report makes the
  outcome unknown and blocks the Task; a report from the same epoch, a reattach by the same node and process, a
  settlement by the coordinator or an abandon ends it. A cancel stops the Dispatch and cancels the Task only once
  the stop is confirmed. Worker errors, failed launches and lost Dispatches count toward a breaker of three with a
  back-off before each retry; rate limits cool the account (runtime, account) down on every node and are not counted; a login
  that is needed blocks the Task. Every node call carries a request id and is answered once (receipts).
- `Reap` applies the timers in `limits.go`: queued Dispatches expire after 5 min, lost leases and unconfirmed stops
  are marked, stalls (15 min without progress), Dispatches past 4 h and nodes with three expiries in a row are
  returned as escalations, as are open questions to the owner after 1 h, then daily; nothing is killed.
- Questions: a worker asks the coordinator or the owner. A `wait` question keeps the worker running, pauses its stall
  and duration timers, and its answer reaches the node in the heartbeat reply until the node acknowledges it. A
  Gate is a final report: the Dispatch ends `gated`, the Task is blocked until the answer, and the next Dispatch
  resumes the Conversation with the question and answer. The first answer wins; the coordinator answers only what
  is addressed to it and can forward a question to the owner. Open questions close when their Dispatch settles (a
  `wait` question) or their Task is canceled (a Gate); a Gate never expires.

- Events: every change writes its events in the same transaction to one log with an increasing `seq`: Runs,
  Tasks and Dispatches with the status they left, Conversations closed, questions opened, answered, forwarded or
  canceled, and the reaper's escalations. Lease renewals, progress, effects and resources are not events. With one
  writer, a later commit always has higher `seq` values, so a reader following `ListEvents` (cursor, limit up to
  500, `has_more`, filters by Run or Task) misses nothing. `Subscribe` wakes readers after each commit with a
  signal that carries no data.

- Nodes and accounts: the owner adds a node, which mints a token shown once (only its SHA-256 is stored); the node
  reports its CLIs (path and version) and worktree root at each connect, and is connected while heard from within
  30 s (any node call counts). A node can be drained and resumed; three expiries in a row mark it unavailable until
  its next hello or a resume. Accounts (runtime, label, position, active or disabled) are kept here with no secret
  value.
- Scheduler: `Schedule` is one pass in one transaction, and `Loop` runs `Reap` and `Schedule` every 2 s and on each
  commit signal. At most 4 Dispatches that have not settled exist at once, one waiting on a question included; the
  coordinator's `CreateDispatch` meets the same limit and checks. Ready Tasks of open Runs go oldest Run first, then
  by position; the runtime, model and effort are the Task's own or its role's default, and the Dispatch records the
  model and effort. An open Conversation continues only on its node, once that node is active, connected, not
  unavailable and below its limit; a new one goes to the least loaded such node that has the runtime and a worktree
  root, ties by id, with the first active account of the runtime that is not cooling down, in
  `<worktree root>/<run>/<task>`. A Task with no node or no account for 5 min is escalated once (`unplaceable`), and
  a rate limit over an hour that leaves its runtime with no free account is escalated (`account_cooling`).

- Runs name the repository their workers work in (`owner/name`) and its base branch (default `main`), and the
  coordinator token that coordinates them, if a coordinator created them. Runs are listed newest first, a page at a
  time.
- Client tokens: kind `owner` or `coordinator`, in Omnara's format (`hyp_<kind>_v1_`, 43 Base62 characters and a
  CRC32 checksum, checked before the database is read; `internal/controlplane/bearertoken`). Shown once; only the
  SHA-256 is stored; a revoked token no longer authenticates.
- Creating a Run or Tasks can carry an idempotency key: the same caller and key with the same request return the first
  result, with another request it is a conflict. The key is kept as a receipt, as node calls are.

Node API (`internal/controlplane/nodeapi`, protocol in `internal/shared/nodeproto`, after Omnara's daemon protocol):
- A node registers with `POST /node/v1/hello` and its bearer token. It sends its CLIs, its worktree root and the
  Dispatches it still holds. Each of those is answered `retain` (still its own at that epoch), `reattach` (marked
  unknown while it was away) or `release`.
- It then holds one WebSocket at `/node/v1/socket` with JSON `{type, payload}` frames of at most 1 MiB.
- The control plane offers the node its queued Dispatches with what it needs (Task, repository, worktree, runtime,
  account, model), sends stops and answers, and acknowledges every heartbeat and report. Each is sent once per
  connection, and again after a reconnect. It looks again on every commit and every 30 s.
- A report is one node call of the orchestration core, with its report id as the request id. A resent report gets
  the same answer. One that can never apply is `permanent_reject`; one that may pass is `transient_error`.
- A second connection of the same node replaces the first, which is told `presence_replaced`.

Client API (`internal/controlplane/clientapi`, contract `api/openapi.yaml`, after Omnara's `internal/httpapi`):
- Served at `/api/v1`. The spec is written by hand; oapi-codegen generates the types, a strict server, a Go client and
  the embedded spec into `clientapi/openapi`.
- Every request is checked against the spec first (`validation_failed`), and bodies are limited to 1 MiB. Errors are
  `{code, message}`.
- Every request carries a client token (`Authorization: Bearer`); without a valid one the answer is 401.
- Each operation has a policy. Every token reads everything and may create a Run; a Run created with a coordinator
  token is coordinated by it. Changing a Run, its Tasks or its questions needs the owner, or the Run's coordinator
  (403 otherwise). An answer is recorded as the owner's or the coordinator's by the token's kind.
- Operations: who am I; list, create, show (with each Task's latest Dispatch), finish and cancel Runs; create Tasks
  with dependencies; show, cancel and reopen a Task; list, show, answer and forward questions; list events; list
  nodes and accounts. Creating a Run or Tasks takes an `Idempotency-Key`.
- Events: a page after a cursor, which can wait up to 50 s for the next event (`wait`) instead of polling; and a
  stream of Server-Sent Events at `/api/v1/events/stream`, each with its seq as id, resumed with `Last-Event-ID`,
  with a comment every 10 s. Waits and streams end when the server shuts down.

The owner's commands:
- On the server, with the same database as `serve`:
  - `nodes add <name>` prints the node's token once;
  - `accounts add <runtime> <label>` records an account;
  - `tokens add <name> [--kind owner|coordinator]` prints a client token once; `tokens list` and
    `tokens revoke <id>`.
- From any machine, over the client API (`internal/controlplane/clientcli`):
  - `login --url URL --token-file FILE` checks the token and keeps both in `~/.hypomnema/client.json` (0600);
  - `run --repo owner/name <objective>` creates a Run with one Task and prints its events (and any question to the
    owner) until the Task ends, then finishes the Run; each read waits for the next event;
  - `answer <question> <number or text>`, and `questions` lists the open questions to the owner;
  - the coordinator's commands: `whoami`; `runs create|list|show|finish|cancel|wait`; `tasks create|show|cancel|reopen`
    (several Tasks with dependencies from one JSON file); `questions [show|forward]`. Each takes `--json`; long text
    comes from a file or `-` for standard input; flags may follow the arguments; a create takes `--key` so a create
    whose answer was lost can be repeated.
  - `runs wait <run>` returns when a Task of the Run ended or was blocked, a question reached the coordinator, an
    escalation came or the Run ended, with the cursor for the next wait and the next commands (`questions show`,
    `tasks show`, `runs finish` once every Task ended); it sends one request per 50 s while nothing happens.
- The coordinator skill (`internal/controlplane/clientcli/skills`, after Orca's
  [decision](docs/decisions/2026-11-09-coordinator-cli-and-skill.md)): `skills get hypomnema-coordinator` prints
  the guide compiled into the binary, `--reference recovery` one reference; `skills install` writes the stub
  `SKILL.md` to `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.agents/skills`, replacing a copy only when it matches a released stub
  (otherwise only with `--force`, keeping a backup). Tests check that every command in the skill parses and that the
  stub and guide share their frontmatter.

Node (`internal/node`):
- `init` writes `~/.hypomnema-node/config.json` (mode 0600, directory 0700) with the control plane's URL, the token
  read from a file, and the worktree root.
- At connect the node finds `claude` and `codex` on its PATH and reads their `--version`.
- The daemon (`internal/node/daemon`) says hello claiming the Dispatches it holds and applies each disposition, then
  holds the socket:
  - heartbeats every 10 s (or as the control plane says), a WebSocket ping every 20 s;
  - reconnects with backoff from 1 s to 30 s with jitter, and stops if the token is refused.
- It records an offer and queues its accept in one transaction, and starts the worker only once the accept is
  acknowledged. It renews each running Dispatch's lease every 30 s and passes stops and answers to its Runner.
- Durable reports (accept, started, question, answer acknowledged, the final report, reattach) wait in a local SQLite
  outbox (`internal/node/statedb`) and are resent after every reconnect until acknowledged; heartbeats and progress
  are not resent.
- Workers (`internal/node/claude`) are Claude Code under a shim (`internal/node/shim`):
  - The daemon starts `hypomnema-node shim --dir run/<dispatch>` in its own session. The shim runs `claude -p` with
    bidirectional stream-JSON and host permission prompts (`--resume` when the Conversation continues, `--model`
    when set).
  - The worker gets a clean environment: PATH, HOME and the locale, plus the account's token
    (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, read from the file named in the node's configuration) and its own
    `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. The spec holding them is deleted once the worker runs.
  - The shim appends each line of the worker's stdout to a journal with an fsync, writes what arrives on its unix
    socket to the worker's stdin, and writes `exit.json` when the worker exits. The runner reads the journal from a
    saved offset, so a new daemon adopts a running worker. A stop sends an interrupt and closes stdin; a worker still
    alive after 30 s is killed with its whole session group.
  - Reported:
    - the session id from `system/init`, as started;
    - progress at most every 30 s;
    - one turn per Dispatch: stdin is closed after the turn's `result`.
  - The worker's tools (`internal/node/workertools`, `hypomnema-node mcp`) come in through `--mcp-config` with
    `--strict-mcp-config`; AskUserQuestion is disallowed. They reach the runner only through a bridge directory beside
    the journal (`internal/node/bridge`), so a question survives a daemon restart.
    - `ask`: the runner submits the question, records the control plane's id, writes the answer for the waiting
      call, and acknowledges it. While it waits, the call sends `notifications/progress` every minute; tool calls may
      last 24 h (`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`). A canceled call withdraws the question.
    - `finish`: the final report, with summary, evidence and an optional Gate. It is the outcome once the worker
      exits.
  - Without `finish`, the outcome is one of:
    - `rate_limited`, after a rejected rate-limit event;
    - `needs_auth`, on a login error;
    - `worker_error`, "stopped without finish", as Orca reports a stop without `worker_done`;
    - exited with no result: the outcome is unknown;
    - a worker that never started is `start_failed`.
  - Every permission prompt is allowed and logged (`node.tool_allowed`). The node's machine or user is the boundary
    ([research](docs/research/2026-11-08-worker-permissions.md)).
  - The first turn, after Orca's preamble, has:
    - the Task's spec, the repository and branch, and the instruction to open a pull request with `gh`;
    - `ask` instead of guessing, `finish` exactly once (with a Gate for decisions the owner must make), and no
      subagents;
    - the recovery note and a resolved Gate.
- Worktrees (`internal/node/worktree`): a bare mirror per repository under the node's home, fetched into
  `origin/*` before each new worktree. `git worktree add -b hyp/<task>` from `origin/<base>`, or from the existing
  branch on a retry; reused while it exists. Git uses the node user's own credentials.
- There is no vault, permission rule or mailbox yet.

## Web client

- `web/`: a Vite single-page app with React, TypeScript, TanStack Router (file routes in `src/routes`) and Query,
  Tailwind and shadcn on Base UI (preset `b43eDcOJc`), pnpm
  ([stack and look](docs/research/2026-11-09-directories-sessions-web-stack.md)).
- The theme (`src/index.css`) has the pink brand color and five status tokens (running, done, needs you, failed,
  queued) for light and dark; dark is the default.
- One screen: the chat, which says the coordinator is not connected yet. It does not call the client API yet.
- `web/embed.go` embeds the build (`web/dist`) into `hypomnema`. `make build` builds the client first.
  - The control plane serves it with `internal/controlplane/webui`, after Omnara's `spa.go`:
    - files as they are, with a year's cache under `assets/`;
    - `index.html` for any other path, with a Content-Security-Policy that allows only its own origin;
    - a 404 for a missing asset or a server path (`api`, `node`, `livez`, `readyz`).
  - A binary built without the client (only `dist/.gitkeep`) serves none.
- In development, `pnpm dev` forwards `/api`, `/livez` and `/readyz` to the control plane (`HYPOMNEMA_API_URL`,
  default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

## Code

```
api                       the client API's contract (openapi.yaml) and oapi-codegen's configuration
internal/controlplane     package controlplane: configuration, migrate, serve and the owner's server commands
internal/controlplane/bearertoken  client token format: making, checking and hashing
internal/controlplane/clientapi  the client API: policies, handlers, events and their stream; generated code in openapi/
internal/controlplane/clientcli  the commands that call the client API, and the coordinator skill (skills/)
internal/controlplane/nodeapi  the node API: hello and the node WebSocket
internal/controlplane/webui    serves the embedded web client
internal/e2e               tests only: the control plane's node API with the node daemon
internal/node             package node: configuration, CLI detection, init, check, run and the systemd unit
internal/node/bridge      the mailbox between a worker's tools and the runner: questions, answers, the final report
internal/node/claude      the Claude Code runner: worker environment, stream-JSON, journal reading, outcome
internal/node/daemon      the node's connection: hello, socket, offers, outbox, Runner interface
internal/node/shim        one worker kept across daemon restarts: journal, input socket, exit file
internal/node/statedb     the node's SQLite state: Dispatches held and the report outbox
internal/node/workertools the worker's MCP server: ask and finish
internal/node/worktree    bare mirrors and git worktrees per Task
internal/controlplane/orchestration  Runs, Tasks, Dispatches, Conversations, questions, events, nodes, accounts, the scheduler; migrations; queries generated by sqlc (internal/store)
internal/shared/nodeproto the wire protocol between a node and the control plane
internal/shared/platform  environment settings, slog logger, HTTP server and probes, version, clock, ids
internal/shared/sqlite    SQLite opening, pragmas and file permissions
web                       the web client (pnpm) and embed.go, which embeds its build
```

There is no vault yet. `internal/e2e` holds only tests, so neither binary links it; it is the one package that
imports both trees. Boundaries ([decision](docs/decisions/2026-11-07-two-deployables.md))
are checked by `make verify`: depguard rules per tree in `.golangci.yml` (the SQLite driver only in `shared/sqlite`,
`database/sql` only in packages that own tables), and `deps-check`, which refuses the control plane and `web` in the node binary
and the node in the control plane binary.

## Verification

- `make verify`: gofmt, `go mod tidy -diff` for both modules, golangci-lint (`.golangci.yml`, tools pinned in
  `tools/ci/go.mod`), the dependency check, `sqlc-check` (generated queries match `sqlc generate`),
  `openapi-check` (generated client API code matches `api/openapi.yaml`), `migration-check` (migrations already on
  `origin/main` are unchanged), unit tests and race tests.
- Tests that need a database open a real file in a temporary directory; no containers.
- `make web-check`: oxlint, oxfmt, `tsc -b` and vitest for the web client; `make web-e2e`: Playwright on the
  production build, at a phone's and a desktop's size.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `make verify` and `govulncheck`, and in a second job `make web-check` and
  `make web-e2e`, on every pull request and on `main`.
